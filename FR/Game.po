The process of souring allows you to preserve cabbage for a long period of time and give it a special flavor and aroma.\r\n\r\nSauerkraut has a characteristic sour-spicy flavor and a tender but crunchy texture. During fermentation, microorganisms convert the natural sugars from the cabbage into lactic and acetic acids, which gives it acidity and preserves the vegetable.\r\n\r\nThe fermentation process begins by cutting fresh cabbage into thin strips or slices. The cabbage is then mixed with salt and left for a few days or weeks to ferment. The vegetables are placed under pressure or pressed to remove excess liquid. The sauerkraut is salted or used in a variety of dishes.\r\n\r\nSauerkraut is a traditional staple in many cuisines around the world. For example, sauerkraut is a sauerkraut popular in Germany and other European countries. Korea is also known for a special type of sauerkraut, kimchi, which is often used in dishes and is a combination of cabbage, vegetables and seasonings.\r\n\r\nSauerkraut has several health benefits - it contains vitamin C, B vitamins, fiber and probiotics that are good for digestion.

It often has glass or polycarbonate walls and a roof to allow sufficient sunlight to penetrate and protect plants from adverse weather conditions such as cold, wind and snow.\r\n\r\nGreenhouses create a unique environment for plants by providing improved temperature and humidity conditions. Inside a greenhouse, temperatures are typically higher than the surrounding environment because the glass walls and roof allow the sun's rays to penetrate and heat the air inside the greenhouse.\r\n\r\nThese conditions create an optimal environment for plant growth and development and allow crops to be grown outside of their normal season or in regions with colder climates. Greenhouses are often used to grow vegetables, flowers, fruits and other high value plants.\r\n\r\nGreenhouses can be equipped with additional equipment such as irrigation systems, heating systems, ventilation systems, and lighting to ensure optimal growing conditions for the plants inside. This allows gardeners and farmers to control and regulate the temperature, humidity and lighting inside the greenhouse to maximize the plants' potential and get high yields.\r\n\r\nGreenhouses can come in a variety of sizes and shapes, from small little structures to large commercial complexes. They can be used in both agricultural and urban gardening and horticulture.\r\n\r\nThe use of greenhouses leads to higher yields and better quality products as they provide a sustainable environment for plants, protecting them from the detrimental effects of weather and disease. In addition, greenhouses allow the management of cultivated space and improve land use efficiency. They also play an important role in the conservation and protection of rare and exotic plant species that require special conditions for survival."

msgid "The Russian stove is a traditional heating device that was widespread in Russia and other CIS countries. It serves not only for space heating, but also acts as a cooking stove and provides the ability to cook food.\r\n\r\nThe Russian oven is usually built of brick or stone, although in some cases other material can be used. It consists of several parts: the firebox, chimneys, vertical shaft, horizontal furnace ducts, and the roaster. The vertical shaft rises upwards from the firebox and serves for flue gas discharge.\r\n\r\nThe Russian stove has a high heat capacity, which means that it heats up slowly but retains heat evenly for a long time even after the fire has gone out. This makes it particularly effective for heating a home, especially during the cold winter months.\r\n\r\nWhen the furnace heats up, hot air rises in a vertical shaft and then travels through the horizontal furnace ducts, distributing heat evenly throughout the room. The top of the stove, called the fryer, is used for cooking and keeping warm.\r\n\r\nOne of the features of the Russian stove is the ability to use it to cook various dishes. Food can be cooked on the griddle, and the lower parts of the stove usually have a special niche where you can store burning coals or wood to maintain a certain temperature.\r\n\r\nThe Russian oven also has an important cultural significance. It is a symbol of the Russian village and traditional way of life. In the past, the oven was the center of family life, around which people gathered, exchanged news and spent time together. The oven also often acts as a decorative element in the Russian interior style, adding a unique charm and authenticity to the room.\r\n\r\nToday, the Russian stove is still used in some villages and country houses, especially in more remote areas where gas or electric heating systems are not always available or are considered uneconomical."

Ingredients: To make blackberry jam, you will need fresh or frozen blackberries, sugar and lemon juice. It is also possible to use pectin to achieve the desired consistency.\r\n\r\n2. Preparing the berries: Blackberries should be thoroughly washed and inspected for damage or rot. Small twigs and stems are also removed.\r\n\r\n3. Preparing the syrup: In a large saucepan, sugar and lemon juice are mixed. The mixture is then heated over medium heat until the sugar is completely dissolved.\r\n\r\n4. Boiling the berries: Blackberries are added to the syrup and the mixture is brought to a boil. The heat is then reduced to medium and the boiling is maintained for 15-20 minutes. During this time, the berries will soften and release their juice.\r\n\r\n5. Treat with pectin (if necessary): If a thicker consistency is desired, pectin is added according to package directions. The pectin should be stirred evenly into the jam to avoid lumps.\r\n\r\n6. Packaging: The hot jam is poured into sterile jars, which are then sealed. The jam is cooled at room temperature and then stored in a cool and dark place.\r\n\r\nCharacteristics of blackberry jam:\r\n\r\n- Flavor: Blackberry jam has a sweet and sour flavor with a bright berry note. It combines the sugar sweetness and freshness of the berries.\r\n- Texture: Depending on preference, the texture of the jam can be thick and chunky, or smoother and pasty.\r\n- Color: Blackberry jam has an intense dark purple or black color, making it very appealing to the eye.\r\n- Use: Blackberry jam can be used as a filling for cakes and pies, and as a jam for bread, rolls and sandwiches. It can also be added to yogurt or ice cream for a special flavor."

Secondly, humus promotes the development of beneficial microorganisms in the soil, which improve its physical and chemical properties and protect plants from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important properties of humus is its ability to last. It gradually releases nutrients, providing stable nutrition for plants over a long period of time. This is especially important for crops that require a constant supply of nutrients, such as vegetable and fruit plants.\r\n\r\nIn addition, humus is an environmentally friendly fertilizer because it is made from natural organic materials. Its use helps to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers that can be harmful to the environment.\r\n\r\nIn agriculture, humus is widely used to fertilize fields and gardens. It can be used as manure, slurry or compost. In addition, humus is also used in horticulture and gardening to make nutrient mixtures and topdressings.\r\n\r\nUltimately, humus is a valuable resource that helps to improve soil quality and increase crop yields.

It consists of a main body with a wick, a kerosene reservoir, a glass cover, and a flame adjustment mechanism.\r\n\r\nThe main part of the kerosene lamp is the reservoir, which is used to store the kerosene. The reservoir is usually of metal or glass construction and can hold a certain amount of liquid. It is sealed airtight to prevent the kerosene from spilling out.\r\n\r\nAbove the reservoir is a wick that is immersed in the kerosene. The wick is made up of special fibers that can absorb and hold the liquid. One end of the wick comes out of the lamp and is usually raised slightly so that it can be lit.\r\n\r\nWhen the wick is lit, kerosene gradually rises gradually through the fibers and keeps the burning going. The flame is adjusted by turning the flame adjustment mechanism, which changes the height of the wick. The higher the wick, the brighter the lamp burns, and if the wick is lowered, the intensity of the light is reduced.\r\n\r\nThe glass hood on the kerosene lamp has several functions. First, it protects the flame from drafts and wind, which helps keep the burning stable. In addition, the cap directs the light in a specific direction, making it more focused and improving illumination.\r\n\r\nKerosene lamps were widely used before electricity and are still used today in certain situations such as hiking, camping or when there is no electricity.

They consist of two main parts: the wooden stick (stem) and the head.\r\n\r\nThe stem of a match is usually made from a dry and flammable wood such as pine or birch. It is narrow and thin, which makes it easier to light. The top part of the stem is called the head or lighter.\r\n\r\nThe match head contains a special substance, such as phosphorus or sulfur, that cracks or burns when rubbed against the cavity of the lighter. When the match head rubs against a ground surface or specialty lighter, the friction creates enough heat to ignite and create a flame.\r\n\r\nMatches are a disposable item as they can only be used once to create a fire. They are widely used for domestic and commercial purposes, including lighting candles, starting a fireplace or campfire on vacation, and for lighting gas stoves and campfires.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that matches should be stored in a dry and cool place so that they do not lose their ignition properties. It is also important to handle them with care and prevent accidental ignition."

msgid "Samogon is an alcoholic beverage produced by distillation of a fermented mixture, most often from various types of cereals, fruits or berries. To obtain moonshine, special apparatuses are used - moonshine machines or moonshine columns.\r\n\r\nThe process of moonshine production begins with fermentation of raw materials, as a result of which sugars are converted into alcohol. This is usually accomplished by adding yeast to the mixture of sugars and water, which begins to ferment, releasing alcohol and carbon dioxide. Fermentation can take several days or weeks, depending on the conditions and type of raw material.\r\n\r\nAfter fermentation, the resulting alcoholic brogue mixture is distilled in a moonshine distiller. Distillation separates the components by their boiling points. The alcoholic vapor formed by heating the braga rises up the column and then cools and condenses again, becoming a liquid that is collected and is moonshine. The distillation process is repeated many times to produce a cleaner, higher quality product.\r\n\r\nThe end result of moonshine can vary greatly depending on the raw materials and production technology. It can have different strength, aroma and taste. Some people prefer to add various flavorings or seasonings such as berries, herbs or spices to give moonshine an extra flavor.\r\n\r\nThe safety of moonshine can be an issue, as the wrong distillation process and improperly purified product can contain harmful substances. Therefore, it is worth remembering that illegal production of moonshine or consumption in an inadequately purified form can lead to serious health problems.\r\n\r\nIn some countries, the production and sale of moonshine is prohibited without a permit or license due to potential health and safety risks."

Construction: A satellite dish consists of a metal dish called a reflector and a converter, or LNB (Low Noise Blockdown Converter) mounted on it. The reflector is usually shaped like a paraboloid and is used to focus the signal onto the LNB.\r\n\r\n2. Location: The satellite dish must be precisely tuned to the satellite orbit from which the signal will be received. The dish is usually mounted on the roof of a building or on a special support so that it has an unobstructed view of the sky.\r\n\r\n3. Principle of operation: When the dish is tuned to the selected satellite, it begins to collect and focus the signals emitted by this satellite to its LNB. The LNB, in turn, converts these signals into electrical signals, which are then transmitted via cable to the satellite receiver.\r\n\r\n4. Quality of reception: The quality and stability of satellite signal reception depends on several factors, such as the size and shape of the dish, the accuracy of the tuning to the satellite, weather conditions, and the presence of obstructions between the dish and the satellite.\r\n\r\n5. Installation and Setup: Installing and setting up a satellite dish requires some knowledge and skills. It is usually done by reputable professionals or a ready-made satellite reception system is purchased which includes the dish, LNB and receiver.\r\n\r\n6. Applications: Satellite dishes are widely used to receive satellite television and radio in homes, apartment buildings, hotels and other commercial facilities. They allow access to a wide selection of television channels and radio stations, including international and specialized broadcast networks."

This process results in the release of heat and produces a characteristic aroma and flavor.\r\n\r\nYeasts look like tiny single-celled organisms that resemble granules or powder of white or light yellow color. They are highly capable of reproduction and activity under optimal conditions of temperature and nutrition.\r\n\r\nIn the food industry, yeast is used as the main ingredient for leavening bread and other bakery products. When yeast is added to dough, it ferments the sugars, resulting in the formation of carbon dioxide bubbles. This gives the bread airiness, volume and softness. In addition, yeast contributes its characteristic flavor and aroma.\r\n\r\nIn brewing and winemaking, yeast plays a key role in the fermentation process. They convert sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide, creating beer and wine. Different yeast strains can have different properties such as alcohol tolerance strength, flavor qualities, and others.\r\n\r\nIn home cooking, yeast is often used for baking bread, pizza, pies and other homemade items. To activate yeast, it is usually mixed with water or other liquid and kept in a warm place so that it can begin to actively multiply and ferment.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that yeast is also a valuable source of nutrients such as B vitamins, minerals and proteins. They can also have a probiotic effect, promoting healthy gut flora.\r\n\r\nOverall, yeast represents an important component of food and beverage production, with its unique properties and abilities that make it an essential part of our daily diet and culinary traditions."

It is usually made of stainless steel or aluminum, which ensures durability and tightness.\r\n\r\nA beer keg has a cylindrical shape and can have different sizes and volumes, from a few liters to several hundred liters. It usually has two openings - one for filling the keg with beer and the other for drawing out the beer.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the quality of the beer, the beer keg is equipped with special valves and an airtight lid. The valves allow you to control the pressure inside the keg and draw the beer without access to air. The lid provides protection from external influences such as light or dirt, which ensures the stability and freshness of the beer.\r\n\r\nThe beer keg can be used both for storing beer in breweries or restaurants and for transporting and selling beer at various events - festivals, concerts, sporting events, etc.\r\n\r\nUsing a beer keg has its advantages. Firstly, it saves space - instead of storing many separate bottles or cans, beer can be stored in a single container. Secondly, a beer keg provides better beer quality due to the lack of air access.\r\n\r\nIn addition, using a beer keg can be more environmentally friendly because there is less waste - no need to throw away many empty bottles or cans.\r\n\r\nOverall, a beer keg is a convenient and efficient way to store and sell beer that preserves its freshness, quality and reduces environmental impact."

The body can be acoustic, electro-acoustic or electric, depending on the type of guitar.\r\n\r\nThe guitar's fingerboard is a long and thin wooden bar on which the metal fret and strings are located. The fingerboard usually has cross markings to help the musician find the right notes and chords.\r\n\r\nA guitar has 6 to 12 strings that are strung along the entire length of the fingerboard. The strings can be made of metal or nylon, depending on the type of guitar. Various techniques are used to play the guitar such as picking, barricades, bends, fingerpicking, chord strumming and others.\r\n\r\nThe guitar allows you to play many styles of music including classical, rock, pop, jazz, folk and many others. It can be used as a solo instrument or as an accompaniment for vocals and other instruments.\r\n\r\nThe guitar is not only a musical instrument, but also a symbol of freedom and self-expression.

They are dark brown or black in color and are usually about 3-4 mm long.\r\n\r\nOnion seeds have a tough outer coating that allows them to remain viable for a long time. They contain the energy and nutrients needed for germination and growth of a new plant.\r\n\r\nOnions are a dicotyledonous plant, so onion seeds can be either male or female. Male seeds produce a pollen, while female seeds produce flower buds in which the seed is formed.\r\n\r\nOnion seeds can be planted directly into the ground or started as seedlings. They require heat and moisture for germination, so it is recommended to soak them in water for a few hours before planting. After that, they are ready for sowing.\r\n\r\nWhen sowing onion seeds, you need to place them at a depth of about 1-2 cm and keep the soil constantly moistened. They will start to germinate within a few days and then turn into young onion plants.\r\n\r\nOnion seeds usually mature a few months after sowing, they can be harvested when the plant is completely dry and the stems have yellowed. Collecting and saving onion seeds allows them to be saved and used for next season's crops.\r\n\r\nIn general, onion seeds are an important element in the cultivation of this plant and allow you to get a harvest of fresh and flavorful onions."

It is officially accepted to classify cottage cheese produced in the traditional way, according to its fat content. According to GOST of the Russian Federation, according to physical and chemical characteristics curd is divided into the following categories: defatted, fat-free, classic and fat. Also according to the method of manufacture there are such types of cottage cheese as plain, soft, as well as grained cottage cheese, which is a type of cottage cheese with reduced fat content.\r\n\r\nMilk-containing product with milk fat substitute, produced in accordance with the technology of curd production, is not called cottage cheese, but cottage cheese product. For example, in Germany they produce cottage cheese with linseed oil, which contains less than 0.5% animal fats, and therefore cholesterol, but contains unsaturated fatty acids such as alpha-linolenic acid. Therefore, this product can be useful for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.\r\n\r\nIn the former Soviet Union curd is made and directly consumed fresh or sweet, in the rest of Eastern and Central Europe - fresh or brackish, in Northern Europe - brackish. To a small extent curd is consumed in Great Britain, North America, Japan, and almost completely absent in Southern Europe and other places in the world.\r\n\r\nThe words \"curd\" and \"cheese\" are separated in modern Russian. In Old Russian, Ukrainian, Serbian and some other Slavic languages the word \"syr\" means both cheese proper and cottage cheese, so products made from cottage cheese are still often called \"cheesy\" (for example, syrniki - Ukrainianism for the Russian \"cottage cheese\", see Ukr. \"syr\"). In English-speaking culture, cottage cheese is considered a type of young soft cheese, while in modern Russian-speaking culture cottage cheese is usually not considered a type of cheese."

World pork production in 2005 was 97.2 million metric tons (according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture).\r\n\r\nOrnamental pygmy pigs (minipigs) are a popular pet in the home.

Sheep meat, called lamb, is one of the most important products of consumption in many countries of the world. In addition to wool and meat, sheep are bred for sheep milk, which is used to make cheese, as well as cooking fat and hides (sheepskin). Finally, sheep are used in scientific experiments: Dolly the sheep, the world's first cloned mammal (in 1996), is considered one of the most famous of this species.\r\n\r\nIn a narrow sense, sheep refers to female domestic sheep, while males are usually referred to as rams. Young females, which have not reached sexual maturity, are referred to as yarks, and the offspring are referred to as lambs.\r\n\r\nSheep breeding, the branch of animal husbandry dealing with sheep breeding, is practiced all over the world and has at all times played an important role in the economies of many countries. At present the sheep population is the largest in China (about 144 millions), Australia (98 millions), India (about 60 millions), Iran (54 millions), New Zealand (44 millions), Great Britain (36 millions), South Africa (over 29 millions), Turkey (27 millions), Pakistan and Spain (24 millions each).

msgid "An axe is a hand tool with a sharp blade attached to the end of the handle. It is used for chopping and splitting wood, as well as for other tasks related to processing and construction.\r\n\r\nAn axe consists of three main parts: the blade, the head, and the handle. The axe blade is a sharp and hardened metal blade, usually elongated in shape, that penetrates material to split it. The head is the part of the axe in which the blade is attached. The head can be made of metal or other strong materials. The handle of an axe is a long wooden or steel bar that is used to hold and manipulate the axe. The handle may have indentations or other special features to improve grip on the user's hand.\r\n\r\nAxes come in a variety of sizes and weights, depending on the intended use. From compact and light axes that are comfortable to use with one hand, to larger and heavier axes that require the use of both hands to work effectively. There are also specialty types of axes, such as chopping axes for woodworking or hatchet axes designed for splitting large logs.\r\n\r\nAxes are widely used in various industries such as logging, construction, repair and crafts. They are used for chopping trees, splitting wood, creating building materials, processing firewood and many other tasks. They can also be used for wilderness survival, creating shelter, building a fire and obtaining food.\r\n\r\nWhen using an axe, it is important to follow basic safety rules, as improper use of the tool can lead to injury. It is important to wear safety glasses, gloves, and other protective equipment when using an axe, and to make sure there are no other people or obstacles around that could be damaged in the process.\r\n\r\nOverall, an axe is a reliable and useful tool that is widely used in a variety of industries. It provides a durable and efficient way to work with wood and other materials that require chopping or splitting."

msgid "A double-barrel shotgun is a type of firearm with two barrels arranged parallel to each other. It gets its name because of its characteristic feature, namely two barrels that allow two cartridges to be fired simultaneously or sequentially.\r\n\r\nA double-barrelled gun can be of two types: with separate barrels or with a common barrel. Separate barrel means that each barrel has its own separate chamber into which the cartridge is inserted. With a common barrel means that both barrels share a common chamber in which both cartridges are inserted.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the type, however, a double-barreled rifle usually has a single trigger that allows one or both barrels to be fired. If both barrels are used at the same time, the double-barrel is capable of firing two rounds at the same time, which can be useful when firing at a fast-moving or multiple targets.\r\n\r\nDouble-barrelled guns can come in a variety of calibers and are designed for different purposes. They can be used for hunting birds and game, for sport shooting, and as a means of self-defense. They can also have different types of bolts, such as horizontal or vertical, which differ in the way the barrels open and close.\r\n\r\nThe double barrel is a popular and well-known type of gun because of its classic and elegant appearance. It is also known for its reliability and efficiency in use. However, as with any firearm, using a double barrel requires knowledge and adherence to safety rules, as well as compliance with laws and regulations regarding gun ownership and use."

msgid "A pickaxe is a tool used for breaking, such as mining ore or rocks. It consists of a usually metal head attached to the end of a wooden or metal handle.\r\n\r\nThe head of a pickaxe usually has two sides: one side with a wide and flat blade, for splitting and breaking material, and the other side, called a crowbar, which has a pointed end part. The crowbar is designed to strike the material to break or split it.\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of a pickaxe is to extract ore and rocks in mining or construction. When miners or construction workers encounter hard materials such as earth, stone, or ore, they use a pickaxe to split and extract these materials. A pickaxe can also be used to dig holes or ditches.\r\n\r\nPickaxes vary in size and weight. Small and light picks may be specifically designed to be used with one hand, while larger and heavier picks require the use of both hands to work effectively.\r\n\r\nWhen using a pickaxe, it is important to follow basic safety rules, as improper use of the tool can lead to injury. It is important to wear safety glasses, gloves, and other protective equipment when working with a pickaxe, and to watch the position of others around you.\r\n\r\nOverall, a pickaxe is a reliable and efficient tool that is widely used in various industries such as mining, construction, and agriculture. Due to its simplicity and versatility, the pickaxe remains one of the most common and useful hand tools."
